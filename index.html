                    related to sanitation with respect to garbage management
                    are degrading immensely. It creates unhygienic
                    conditions for the citizens in the nearby surrounding,
                    leading to the spread of infectious diseases and illness.<br/>
                    &nbsp; &emsp; 
                    Nowadays, garbage issues have become a serious thing in 
                    maintaining the cleanliness of the city. Many of the city areas 
                    are still without public garbage bins so the garbage is thrown at 
                    the roadside or at the corners in the locality, which creates 
                    ugliness at the corners. Worldwide interest in Smart Cities has aggrandized,
                    fostered by the need to find effective remedies to the
                    major challenges foreseen for the next years. As one of
                    the application of Smart City, Waste Management in a
                    city is a formidable challenge faced by the public
                    administrations.<br/>
                    &nbsp; &emsp;
                    With the proliferation of population, the scenario of
                    cleanliness with respect to waste management has become
                    crucial. Waste management includes planning, collection,
                    transport, treatment, recycle and disposal of waste
                    together with monitoring and regulation. The existing
                    waste management system, where the garbage is collected
                    from the streets, houses and other establishments on
                    quotidian basis, is not able to effectively manage the
                    waste generated.</p>

                    To avoid the above problem, IoT based “Smart Waste
                    Management” is the best and trending solution. In the
                    proposed system, public dustbins will be provided with
                    embedded device which helps in real time monitoring of
                    level of garbage in garbage bins. The sensors being placed at the
                    topmost level in the bin, sense the level of the garbage in
                    that bin. The data regarding the garbage levels will be used 
                    to provide optimized route for garbage collecting vans, 
                    which will reduce cost associated with fuel.<br/>
                    &nbsp; &emsp; 
                    Through this web app a normal layman can also see the levels of the 
                    dustbin around his/her area and the when was last time garbage was collected
                    from that bin and who was responsible for collecting that garbage. 
                    This will help a layman to keep a check on municipality.
